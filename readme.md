### Prerequisites

Create a file named `.env` with contents similar to the following:

```
ENDPOINT=474b401e-ae39-4b9f-bb22-ad3d2d6df47e.access.udf.f5.com
USERNAME=svcapi
PASSWORD=svcAPI!
```

You may also need to install the `dotenv` library, which is used to store environment variable values outside of the script.

```
pip install python-dotenv
```
