### Prerequisites

Create a file named `.env` with contents similar to the following:

```
ENDPOINT=10.1.1.13
USERNAME=yourusername
PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

You may also need to install the `dotenv` library, which is used to store environment variable values outside of the script.

```
pip install python-dotenv
```
